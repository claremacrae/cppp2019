# gilded_rose_refactoring_kata/

A worked example of the [cpp version of Emily Bache's GildedRose Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/cpp).

The [history](https://github.com/claremacrae/cppp2019/commits/master/gilded_rose_refactoring_kata) shows the steps I went through to improve the test coverage of this code.

The percentage code-coverage values quoted come from using [OpenCppCoverage and its Visual Studio Plugin](https://github.com/OpenCppCoverage). Note that in [0c87bcb24bb6b6ab72a8be2723f2f458](0c87bcb24bb6b6ab72a8be2723f2f458) I added a load of `else` blocks to improve the test coverage of conditional values, as show that this tool does not measure conditional coverage.
